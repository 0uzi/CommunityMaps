Community Maps
==============

This repo contains maps created by community members of Overcast Community.

# Licensing

Thanks to the hard work of [MCResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/) many of the Overcast Network classics were licensed and achieved allowing them be freely downloaded and used.

We hope to continue with this standard and will **only be accepting new maps that have the [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license**. This allows servers to use them commercially (where donations and ranks exist). Read more in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
